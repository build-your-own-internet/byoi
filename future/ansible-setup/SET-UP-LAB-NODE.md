# Setting up a Lab Node

## Starting with digital ocean

Note: if you don't want to use digital ocean, you can use any other cloud
provider that supports docker. You'll just need to get an Ubuntu 24.04 machine
set up with ssh access.

1. Install `doctl` (this is the digital ocean cli). You can do this with `brew install doctl` or `snap install doctl`

2. Authenticate with doctl:

    ```bash
    doctl auth init
    ```

3. If you don't have an ssh key, create one with the following command:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    ```

4. Add the ssh key to your digital ocean account with the following command:

    ```bash
    doctl compute ssh-key create mytest --public-key "$(cat  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)"
    ```

5. List your ssh keys with the following command:

    ```bash
    doctl compute ssh-key list
    ```

6. Set your ssh key ID as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export SSH_KEY_ID=<your-ssh-key-id>
    ```

### Building the lab node

1. Create a droplet with the following command:

    ```bash
    export HOST_NAME=build-your-own-internet-lab-3
    doctl compute droplet create \
        --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY_ID \
        --image ubuntu-24-04-x64 \
        --size s-2vcpu-4gb \
        --user-data-file "./setup-ansible.sh" \
        --region sfo3 \
        $HOST_NAME
    ```

2. Find the Public IP address of the droplet with the following command:

    ```bash
    while sleep 1; do
    doctl compute droplet list --format PublicIPv4 --no-header
    done
    ```

    > üìù NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the droplet to become active and for it to have an IP address.

    Assign that IP address to the `IP_ADDRESS` environment variable:

    ```bash
    export IP_ADDRESS=<your-ip-address>
    ```

3. SSH into the droplet with the following command:

    ```bash
    $ ssh root@$IP_ADDRESS
    The authenticity of host '137.184.179.253 (137.184.179.253)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:ecjoIp/DNuZIvKIWdoVOhKedryaBhgjRZooH1iYMKGU.
    This key is not known by any other names.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
    ```

4. Clone down the BYOI repo and run the playbook to set up the test user:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/build-your-own-internet/byoi.git
    ```

5. Switch to the appropriate branch

    ```bash
    cd byoi
    ```

6. Install Ansible:

    This may take a few minutes.

    ```bash
    cd ansible-setup/
    apt update;apt install -y software-properties-common;add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible;apt install -y ansible;
    ```

7. Set the test user password:

    Ansible requires that passwords be provided in an encrypted (hashed) format when setting user passwords. To set the password securely without storing it in the playbook, we can use an environment variable to pass the hashed password to the playbook.

    ```bash
    export TEST_USER_PASSWORD=$(openssl passwd -6 "your-super-secret-password")
    ```

8. Run the playbook:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook setup_test_user.yml
    ```

9. Test that the test user can run BYOI commands:

    Log out of the droplet. Then log back in as the test user with the following command:

    ```bash
    ssh test@$IP_ADDRESS
    ```

10. Start the BYOI lab server:

    Now, as the test user, run the following command to start the BYOI lab server:

    ```bash
    byoi-rebuild
    ```

You're done!
